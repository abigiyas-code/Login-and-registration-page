When we design a db we have to design 3 things first:
    db migration using a command: migrate create -ext <extension file name> -dir <following path directories> -seq <name of the migrate file db>
    queries file of holding sql data
    Generate sqlc data from the 2 sources using command sqlc generate 

DB Transaction: is a way of transaction of data from multiple tables;
              : this db transaction satisfies ACID property; Atomicity, Consistancy; Isolation; Durability   
     Operation: It starts with BEGIN; and ends with COMMIT; command    and if it thier is failure we handle by using a command of BEGIN; and ROLLBACK;
        Steps follow: -> Create a function that excutes the transactin of data
                      -> Create a function that support each transaction type of data for each table we created in 
                      ->
